This project is really just the result of a little refactoring excersise of the endproduct of Robert C. Martin's Bowling Game Kata. 
I wanted to try out and apply the Clean Code rules on the resulting algorithm, which is a bit hard to understand. 
I believe that the current version is more understandable than the code where Uncle Bob's kata stops.
